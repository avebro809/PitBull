        <p>Pit Bulls are the worlds most misunderstood dog breed in the world. Today, Pit Bulls remain
          largely misunderstood because of irresponsible owners, sensationalist news stories, and a proliferation
          of myths. Here are just 5 of many misconceptions of the Pit Bull that continue to give this resilient, loving,
          and loyal breed its negative stigma.

  <h1>"Pit Bulls have the strongest bite force and have locking jaws."</h1>
</div>
  <h2>THE TRUTH:</h2>
    <p>There are many studies that have proven there is no difference
between the jaw of a Pit Bull and jaws of other breeds, inlcuding zero evidence of a locking jaw. In addition, other breeds such as the
Rottweiler and the German Shepherd are known to have a stronger bite force (In pounds of force).

  <h1>"Pit Bulls are born to fight and are inherently vicious."</h1>
</div>
  <h2>THE TRUTH:</h2>
    <p>This misconception is warped toward generalizing and condemning an entire breed based upon the behavior a few dogs because of
actions of bad owners. The truth is that each dog should be judged based own its own merits and not by its breed.</p>

    <p>
In fact, the term “pit bull” doesn’t actually refer to a specific breed of dog. It’s a generic term that usually means dogs who are one of a couple of types of terriers.
There is no evidence that Pit Bulls are more dangerous than other dogs because the breed identification is nearly impossible. There are lots of mixes of breeds of dogs
who look like what people think of as a Pit Bull. What may be classified as a "Pit Bull" based on looks could potientially DNA test for a cross between a Boxer and Labrador Retriever!
Do you think you can spot the true American Pit Bull Terrier?

  <h1>"Pit Bulls are aggressive and are not suited for a family with children."</h1>
</div>
  <h2>THE TRUTH:</h2>
    <p>Actually in the early part of the 1900’s, the Pit Bull was known as the “Nanny Dog” for children because of its faithful and loving disposition. They were strong
        and loyal and were considered one of the most beloved dogs. Sadly these qualities have caused this breed to be victimized by abuse of humans, and the responsibility
        of poor actions of Pitbulls lie in the hands of the owner.

  <h1>"Once aggressive bully breed dogs cannot be rehabilitated."</h1>
</div>
  <h2>THE TRUTH:</h2>
    <p>Pit bulls are one of the most resilient dog breeds. For a prime example, 49 of the 50 Pit Bulls of Michael Vick’s dog fighting ring have rehabilitated and are in loving
       homes of families. Jim Gorant, a senior writer for Sports Illustrated, has been following the 49 surviving pit bulls and written a book about their story called The Lost Dogs:
       Michael Vick's Dogs and Their Tale of Rescue and Redemption.

  <h1>"Banning Pit Bulls from a community makes an environment safer."</h1>
</div>
  <h2>THE TRUTH:</h2>
    <p>When it comes to keeping a community safe by enforcing dangerous dog laws, the focus should be on negligent and reckless owners, not a breed. The responsibilty should be put
      back into the hands of the owner. In other words, A Breed Neutral Legislation should be used to control the situation of dangerous dogs and not to condemn one specific breed.
